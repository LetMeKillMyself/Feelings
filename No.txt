If you would ask me i have no clue what feelings are maybe you feel warmer or colder by it but maybe thats just the season i want to know how it is to be happy because happy is a feeling but i dont know if i can feel that feeling i dont think i have ever been happy not on my birthdays or when i got something not even when i punched my bully knock-out in one punch and i think happy is a feeling you feel when your proud of yourself but proud is also a feeling i think so i have never felt proud before i think never... atleast i cant remember if i have ever been proud of myself but i do remember my full "Childhood" so my question is What is a feeling? and my awnser is that i have still no clue thank you for letting me waste your time. greetings Pax.
