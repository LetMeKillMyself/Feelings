What are feelings?

I know it looks weird above because i dont know how to make it look like a normal sentence but you can figure it out.

To install this repsitory on your computer you need to follow these instructions.

To install Feelings on Windows via cmd(Command Prompt):
  - You need to have git installed on you computer you can do that by first installing Python on there offcical website here https://www.python.org/downloads/ it doesnt matter what version.
  - While installing it on your computer you will see something like "install into terminal" if you look under it you will see an option that says "Install Pip" click om that and go further with the installation.
  - If you did everything right you will have Python on you computer to check if it is indeed installed go to the Left side of your screen and then all the way down you will see "Type here to search" click on that
  - and then type "cmd" and click on "Open" there type "python --version" it will say back "Python (version of your python.)" if you see that you installed Python if not you did something wrong.
  - Next step is going to the directory you want this repository to be in for now its best to but the files on you Desktop so you dont lose them and you can later drag them somewhere else.
  - To go to the Desktop you type "cd C:\Users\YOUR USER\Desktop\" where it says YOUR USER you need to type your user to find your user open cmd(Command Prompt) again if you have closed it.
  - if not you can also see it before you put in the command it will say something like this "C:\Users\Pax>" this is what i see but you will see something else Where the name Pax is you can see your own user.
  - now you have found that you can put this in your cmd(Command Prompt) "cd C:\Users\YOUR USER\Desktop\" if you havent done that already.
  - Now type "pip install git" in your cmd(Command Prompt) this will install git.
  - When its installed type "cls" in your cmd(Command Prompt) this will clear everything in your cmd(Command Prompt) so it looks cleaner.
  - Now git is installed you need to type in your cmd(Command Prompt) the next command "git clone cd https://github.com/LetMeKillMyself/Feelings.git" this will automaticly install all the files from the repository on your computer.
  - Now you can close your cmd(Command Prompt).
  - So if you now go to your Desktop you will see a folder called Feelings-main.
  - Thanks for installing Feelings.

To install Feeling on Windows without cmd(Command Prompt).
  - You need to have Winrar installed atleast that is what i use install Winrar from here https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=16 .
  - If your on https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=16 click on "Download Winrar" under "Buy Winrar" then just install it.
  - When you have installed it you will see some popups about that its a 40 day trial and that you need to buy it but dont worry you can just close those popups.
  - Also the 40 days trial doesnt work so you will have Winrar forever.
  - then go back to https://github.com/LetMeKillMyself/Feelings there you scroll up until you see a green button that says "Code" click on that.
  - Then click on "Download ZIP" then it will download Feelings-main.zip.
  - when its done downloading you can put it anywhere but i like to have it on my Desktop.
  - To extract the zip file right click on the Feelings-main.zip and click "Extract Here" then you can delete Feelings-main.zip.
  - if you look on your Desktop you will see a folder called Feelings-main.
  - Thanks for installing Feelings
